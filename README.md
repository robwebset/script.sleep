The Sleep addon behaves like a standard TVs sleep timer where you can vary the length of time before Kodi will shut down. It is designed to be mapped to a button on your remote control (Configurable in the settings) so you can launch, add time and view the current setting by the use of a single button.

Current Features Include:
* Setting the timer to allow shutdown after a set time
* Extend existing set timers (Additions configurable)
* Cancel existing timer
* Countdown before shutting down, with the option to cancel or extend
* Set the timer to shut down after a video finished (Note: This is the video finishing on it's own, not being stopped)
* Sleep can run as a screensaver - so after a set time of inactivity it will present the shutdown dialog
* Notification reminders for how much time remains
* Ability to assign any button to control the Sleep Timer
* Ability to Dim the screen while the timer is set (Night Time Mode!)

You can launch the Sleep Configuration window in the following ways:
* From the "Programs" area of Kodi
* Via a remote control or keyboard button (Configurable which button)
* As a screensaver
