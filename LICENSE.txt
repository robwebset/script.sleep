in this agreement.

rights in the Software not expressly granted to you here.

Disclaimer of Warranty

The author disclaims any responsibility for harm resulting from the Software
or any software or content downloaded using the Software, whether or not the
author approved such software or content. The authors approval does not guarantee
that software or content from an approved partner will function, sound, or appear
as offered or hoped, or be complete, accurate, or free from bugs, errors, viruses,
or other harmful content. The author expressly disclaims all warranties and 
conditions, express or implied, including any implied warranties and conditions of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement, and any
warranties and conditions arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade 
regarding the Software or any software or content you download using the Software.
No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the author or 
elsewhere will create any warranty or condition not expressly stated in this 
agreement. Some jurisdictions do notallow certain limitations on implied warranties,
so the above limitation may not apply to you to its full extent.

Limitation of Liability

The authors total liability to you from all causes of action and under all theories
of liability will be limited to $0.00. In no event and under no theory of liability
will the author be liable to you for any special, incidental, exemplary, or 
consequential damages arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the software
whether or not the author has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The 
foregoing limitations will survive even if any limited remedy specified is found to have
failed of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or 
exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation
or exclusion may not apply to you to its full extent.
